ADMIN ACCESS SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
=============================

To set up admin access, follow these steps:

1. Create a .env.local file in your project root (if it doesn't exist already)
   - On Windows: Right-click > New > Text Document > Rename to ".env.local"
   - On Mac/Linux: Run `touch .env.local` in the terminal

2. Add the following line to your .env.local file:
   ADMIN_EMAIL=your-actual-email@example.com
   
   Replace "your-actual-email@example.com" with the email address you use to sign in to the application.

3. Restart your Next.js development server:
   - Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   - Run `npm run dev` again

4. Sign in to the application using the email address you specified in the .env.local file

5. Navigate to /admin in your browser

If you're still having issues:
- Check the console logs in your terminal for debugging information
- Make sure you're signed in with the correct email address
- Verify that the .env.local file is in the root directory of your project
- Try clearing your browser cache and cookies

For development purposes, the middleware has been updated to allow access to admin routes if ADMIN_EMAIL is not set, so you should be able to access the admin panel even without setting up the environment variable.
